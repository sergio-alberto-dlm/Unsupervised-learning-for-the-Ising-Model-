# Unsupervised-learning-for-the-Ising-Model-
This repository was inspired by the article 'Unsupervised learning of phase transitions: from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders', first we revisited the variational autoencoder and then we apply to the 2D Ising model for phase transition detection.
